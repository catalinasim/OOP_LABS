Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object is an instance of a class, which can contain both data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. OOP is widely used in modern programming languages like Java, Python, C++, and Kotlin, as it promotes modularity, reusability, and scalability in code.
